## Tailwind CSS Customization

The project uses Tailwind's utility-first approach for styling. To customize the design, update the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#4A90E2",
        secondary: "#50E3C2",
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
